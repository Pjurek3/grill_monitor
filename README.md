# grill_monitor
Development of my grill monitor app with python and node MCU.  The monitor measures the temperature of the food at the grill and transmits this to the website on request.  This is setup to work with a an open api which can be called to receive the temp, runs the temp and the returns the temp.  This is designed to work with either an external website or phone.
